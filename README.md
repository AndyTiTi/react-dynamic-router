# Dynamic Routing with React Router and Infinite Nesting Comment

## Project Introduction

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with Vite, React, and React Router, demonstrating how to implement dynamic routing with loops and an infinite nesting comment reply feature.

## Features

- **Dynamic Loop Routing**: Dynamically generate route structures by parsing route configuration.
- **Infinite Nesting Comments**: Users can reply to comments, supporting an unlimited level of nesting.
- **Modern Tooling**: Utilizes Vite for building, React for the frontend framework, React Router for route management, and pnpm as the package manager.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (the latest stable version is recommended)
- pnpm or npm/yarn as the package manager

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the project to your local machine
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AndyTiTi/react-dynamic-router.git
   ```
2. Enter the project directory
   ```
   cd your-project
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```
   pnpm install
   // or use npm
   npm install
   // or use yarn
   yarn
   ```

### Running the Development Server

```
pnpm run dev
// or
npm run dev
// or
yarn dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

### Building for Production

```
pnpm run build
// or
npm run build
// or
yarn build
```

## Dynamic Loop Routing

Dynamic loop routing creates `<Route>` components dynamically by parsing route configuration files or object arrays. This allows the route structure to be flexibly adjusted according to the configuration without hardcoding.

## Infinite Nesting Comment Reply Feature

The comment system allows users to post comments on specific content and reply to other users' comments. The system supports infinite levels of nesting, enabling in-depth discussions on topics.

## Technology Stack

- **Vite**: A modern front-end build tool that is fast and efficient.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: A routing library for React applications.
- **pnpm**: A fast and disk-space-saving package manager.
